# Context-Aware Organization - AI Bookmark Manager

## 🎯 Smart Folder Detection

### **The Problem You Identified:**
- Extension was using static scopes (All, Bookmarks Bar, Other)
- Didn't consider what folder the user was currently viewing
- No awareness of current bookmark context

### **The Solution:**
**Context-aware organization** that detects where you are and organizes accordingly.

## 🧠 How It Works

### **Automatic Context Detection:**
```javascript
// When you're viewing chrome://bookmarks/?id=272 (Universities folder)
Context Detected: {
  type: 'folder',
  folderId: '272', 
  folderName: 'Universities',
  bookmarksFound: 4
}

// Extension automatically suggests: "Organize Universities folder"
```

### **Smart Scope Options:**
1. **Current Folder (Smart)** ← New default
   - Detects what folder you're viewing
   - Organizes only that folder's contents
   - Updates description dynamically

2. **All bookmarks** ← Original behavior
3. **Bookmarks Bar** ← Specific scope  
4. **Other Bookmarks** ← Specific scope

## 🎮 User Experience

### **Scenario 1: Viewing Specific Folder**
```
1. User opens chrome://bookmarks/?id=272 (Universities folder)
2. Opens AI Bookmarks extension
3. Sees: "Current Folder (Smart)" → "Organize Universities folder (4 bookmarks)"
4. Clicks "🤖 Organize"
5. Only organizes the 4 bookmarks in Universities folder
```

### **Scenario 2: Main Bookmarks View**
```
1. User is on chrome://bookmarks (main view)
2. Opens AI Bookmarks extension  
3. Sees: "Current Folder (Smart)" → "Organize all bookmarks"
4. Clicks "🤖 Organize"
5. Organizes all bookmarks
```

### **Scenario 3: Manual Override**
```
1. User is viewing Universities folder
2. But wants to organize everything
3. Changes scope to "All bookmarks"
4. Sees: "Found 150 bookmarks in All Bookmarks"
5. Organizes everything instead of just current folder
```

## 🔍 Context Detection Logic

### **URL Pattern Recognition:**
- `chrome://bookmarks` → All bookmarks
- `chrome://bookmarks/?id=1` → Bookmarks Bar
- `chrome://bookmarks/?id=2` → Other Bookmarks  
- `chrome://bookmarks/?id=272` → Specific folder (Universities)

### **Dynamic Folder Detection:**
```javascript
// Detects current folder from URL
const folderId = urlParams.get('id');
const folder = await chrome.bookmarks.get(folderId);

// Updates UI automatically
"Current Folder (Smart)" → "Organize Universities folder"
```

### **Bookmark Counting:**
```javascript
// Scans folder contents recursively
Found 4 bookmarks in "Universities":
- buffalo
- University of Southern California | Applicant Login
- FSU  
- syracuse
```
